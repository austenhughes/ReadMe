# ReadMe Generator 

This is an application to help build quick and easy readme files. You can then take these and copy them into you’re working project. 

Installations : 
inquirer- npm
https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer

how to use : 

Open the terminal and use node to call the readme index.js file. 

When you run this file you will be presented with a series of questions in the terminal. 

You will be asked for:
    -the title of your project
    -a description of your project
    -what license does your project have 
    -who were the collaborators 
    -what test (if any) were run/used in building this code 
    -what recourses were used 
    -contact info … both github username and email address 

The application will then take all of this information and format a nice readMe markdown 
Including 
    -License icons you can click on to take you to that license page 
	-Working table on contents 
	-github and email set up as links
